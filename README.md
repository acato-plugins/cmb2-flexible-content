##Approach

Add layouts array to `$cmb->add_field()` that will let users add different kinds of layouts consisting of text fields, image fields, etc.

The field will use AJAX to render the group in the admin and show the layout types available.

Store the data (WIP)

Render the field on the front end (WIP)
